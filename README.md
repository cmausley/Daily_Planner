*HTML*
1. In the HTML we begin by linking to Bootstrap (cue Jumbotron heading) and a few links for prettier fonts, alongside our CSS. ALL OF THESE ARE KEPT IN THE HEAD.
2. The inserted jumbotron from Bootstrap provides the heading of the page.
3. We then insert a container for each time row. Every row must contain a time block, text area, and a save button.
4. "col-2" provides the dashed area overtop the time chunks.

*CSS*
1. Already laid out for us (thank you!)
2. Outlines our text area, cool to see the hover feature for the save button. 
3. Shifts colors for past, present, and future.

*JAVASCRIPT*
